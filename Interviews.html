						<h2>Ansley Stone</h2>
						<p class="info">Student</p>

						<ol>
							<li>
								<h4>Who are you? What do you do?</h4>
							
								<p>I am a student at Clemson University studying International Business. I am from Columbia, South Carolina and love to spend my time volunteering with nonprofits and other organizations as a way of serving God. I have worked with many different organizations in Columbia as a volunteer.</p>
							</li><li>
								<h4>Have you ever volunteered with an organization aiming to eradicate hunger, specifically on a local level?</h4>
							</li>
							<p>I have volunteered with food pantry organizations in Richland Two and also have worked with Harvest Hope and the Oliver Gospel Mission. 
							</p>
							<li>
								<h4>What is important to you when picking where you want to spend time volunteering? </h4>
							</li>
							<p>I grew up as a Christian and still am a Christian today. I think when picking somewhere to volunteer it is important to me that they are doing things in the community that are beneficial, and it is a plus to me if they are a Christian Organization aiming to spread the love of Jesus.
							</p>
							<li>
								<h4>How did volunteering affect you personally? </h4>
							</li>
							<p>Volunteering throughout my childhood allowed me to understand the importance of helping others in my community. It also impacted what I want to do for a living. I want to study business so I can better serve my community and meet the needs of the people around me. </p>
							<li>
								<h4>When you visited the Feed My Sheep website, how was your experience? </h4>
							</li>
							<p>I clicked on the website and it loaded great! looks like it’s meant for a laptop, but it loaded fine! when I clicked on the volunteer application it gave me two options: download or view. at first I tried downloading it but the file downloaded onto my phone as a word doc so it was kinda weird. Then I just viewed the document which pulled it up great as a pdf. The only thing is that I have no way of filling it out on my phone unless I use a photo editing app. So it would be easier for me if it was a google form or something because it wasn’t super obvious how to fill it out or where to submit it!
							</p>
							<li>
								<h4>Based off their website would you want to volunteer with them?</h4>
							</li>
							<p>
								Yeah the mission itself sounds super cool! I’d have the mission statement higher up on the website though because I had to scroll to find what it was about. But it seems super cool. I might would refresh the website a bit and make it look newer.
							</p>
						</ol>
						<p>This interview with Ansley allowed me to understand the viewpoints of a user for the site. It also allowed me to narrow down what is important based off of hierarchy.</p>
