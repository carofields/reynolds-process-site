						<h1>Design Challenge</h1>
					</header>
					<header>
						<p>The first step of the process was identifying the design challenge. Using the IDEO Human Centered Design Toolkit as a guide for questions to help narrow down the core problems with the site.</p>
					</header>
					<h2>What is the problem you're trying to solve?</h2>
					<p>Helping the community in need in Columbia, South Carolina.</p>
					<h2>Frame it as a design question.</h2>
					<p>How can the FMSM&M website help people in need in Columbia? </p>
					<h2>Now, state the ultimate impact you're trying to have. </h2>
					<p>Make the resources of FMSM&M more accessible for donating and receiving their services.</p>
					<h2>What are some possible solutions to your problem?</h2>
					<p>Having a homepage that separates for people who are in need and people that want to donate their time and items. A navigation bar that makes it easier to find the information you are looking for. Separate pages for each of the services they have available. A clear way to communicate with their executives. </p>
					<h2>Finally, write down some context and constraints that you're facing. </h2>
					<p>Only being in the city of Columbia. Not knowing exactly what all is the most important service FMSM&M offers. Deciding what is most important for the community. Redesigning the whole website to be more useful. </p>
					<h2>Does your original question need tweaking? Try it again.</h2>
					<p>How can the Feed My Sheep website define their goals as a ministry and help make their resources more easily available?</p>
