			<h2>Primary Research</h2>
			<p>While Feed My Sheep Movement and Ministry has hearts for service, their current website makes their resources hard to access. They are a national and state recognized nonprofit ministry whos goal is to "feed God's people mind, body,and soul". They focus on providing personal hygiene items, food, and clothing for veterans, the elderly,and homeless communities of Columbia, South Carolina.</p>

			<p>Their website is in desparate need of some help. The site is impossible to navigate in browser without missing information due to no navigation bar, text that runs of the page, and overlapping elements. The website lacks a clear logo and features no sort of hierarchy. While they are doing great things in their community, it would make a lot more sense for their website to feature a navigation bar to make the information more accessible and organized. It features overwhelming typefaces, mistakenly paired colors, and animated backgrounds that do not assist in the overall message of their ministry. It is hard to gain information on their individual resources and would cause a lot of stress to any user of their site. </p>

			<p>Their Instagram account, while trying hard to post images that are applicable to them, needs some help trying to communicate the overall understanding of their ministry and providing branding that communicates their message. I think they are doing great things but need assistance in being consistent with their branding and making their resources more accessible to the population.
