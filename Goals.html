					<p>In class we worked through an ideation activity where we used Post It Notes to thoroughly investigate who our audience includes. In <a href="images/IMG_6166.HEIC">this image</a> you can see where I began the process. The categories are labeled direct and indirect, which are shown as the green notes. Under them are orange notes that showcase people in either category. Next to the orange notes are potentially indirect groups, featured in the blue color. </p>
					<break></break>
					<p>The next step was adding another category, which can be seen in <a href="images/IMG_6167.HEIC">this image</a> was writing down who would be a fan of finding a solution and who would be skeptical. Under these categories, individuals or groups were listed in orange. Below these featured <a href="images/IMG_6168.HEIC">an either way section.</a></p>
